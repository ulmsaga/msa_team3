brew install hookdeck/hookdeck/hookdeck

hookdeck logout

hookdeck login --cli-key 4w5gwx3kl0t0ua2ctbf5al0vdbpxp95xzvlcwjvesrox4y3set

hookdeck listen 9200 source --cli-path /monitor

If the login command is executed multiple times, it may result into 401 error.
To resolve this, run the "hookdeck logout" command, followed by login command

If it is not asking for the forwarded path, pls run the below command, 
"hookdeck listen 9200 source --cli-path /monitor"
When you are running the above command, you don't have to provide the hostname (localhost) specifically
